# SimpleCalculator

This is a simple calculator that asks for the first and second number of a calculation. It then asks for an operator and after inputting a readable opperator the program performs the calculation and outputs the result to the user. The calculator then asks the user if they would like to continue if no then the program ends if yes the program returns to the begining asking for the first and second number again repeating.
